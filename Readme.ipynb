    "# Real Estate Sales Analysis and Price Prediction (2001-2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds an initial **predictive model** for real estate sale prices based on a dataset of property transactions from 2001 to 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to explore the data, understand key factors affecting property prices, and build a simple predictive model to estimate sale prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** [Real Estate Sales 2001-2022 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omniamahmoudsaeed/real-estate-sales-2001-2022)  \n",
    "- **File:** `real-estate-sales-2001-2022.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programming Language:** Python\n",
    "- **Libraries:**\n",
    "  - Pandas\n",
    "  - Numpy\n",
    "  - Matplotlib\n",
    "  - Seaborn\n",
    "  - Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "    - Data Cleaning:\n",
    "        - Removing missing values (`NaN`)\n",
    "        - Handling duplicates\n",
    "        - Standardizing date formats\n",
    "    - Feature Exploration:\n",
    "        - Town, property type, residential type, floor area\n",
    "    - Temporal Analysis:\n",
    "        - Price trends over time (by Date of Sale)\n",
    "    - Outlier Detection:\n",
    "        - Identifying extreme values in Price and Floor Area\n",
    "    - Correlation Check:\n",
    "        - Exploring relationships between numerical features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive Modeling**\n",
    "    - Model used: **Linear Regression**\n",
    "    - Train-test split performed\n",
    "    - Model evaluated using:\n",
    "        - R² score\n",
    "        - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test R² score:** 0.2854\n",
    "- **Test RMSE:** 627,731.69\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **R² score of 0.2854** indicates that the model explains approximately 28.5% of the variance in sale prices.\n",
    "- The **RMSE of ~627K** suggests that predictions have a high average error — this is expected given that a simple Linear Regression model was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- The EDA successfully identified several key factors affecting property prices, such as:\n",
    "    - Location (town and region)\n",
    "    - Property type and residential type\n",
    "    - Floor area\n",
    "    - Temporal trends in sale prices\n",
    "- The initial model (Linear Regression) provided a basic understanding of price prediction, but performance is limited and can be improved with more advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "    - Create new features (e.g., `price per sqm`, `year of sale`) to extract more value from the data.\n",
    "2. **Model Development**\n",
    "    - Explore more complex models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Data Imputation**\n",
    "    - Handle missing values systematically using appropriate imputation methods.\n",
    "4. **Outlier Treatment**\n",
    "    - Address extreme values to reduce noise in the model.\n",
    "5. **Advanced Exploration**\n",
    "    - Investigate interaction effects and potential clustering for deeper insights.\n",
